# SeraOS OpenVR Driver
This repo was forked from an example driver in order to not reinvent the wheel. Using this driver, this will define an interface from which a full VR tracked setup can be used digitally from function calls and event systems. First implementation demonstration will be in SeraOS, an aspect of Seranova
